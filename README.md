Personal project in understanding ODBC (Open Database Connectivity).

Contains:
- "OdbcEasyLibrary", a collection of functions for my personal use.
- "OdbcEasyController", a class implementation of the functions.

None of this is meant for professional use, all is done for learning ODBC and general practice.

They are also used in some of my projects.
