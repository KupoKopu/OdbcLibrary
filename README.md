Personal project in understanding ODBC (Open Database Connectivity).

Contains:
- "OdbcEasyLibrary", a collection of functions for my personal use.
- "OdbcEasyController", a class implementation of the functions.

These codes are done with the intention of getting to know of ODBC.

They are also used in some of my projects.
